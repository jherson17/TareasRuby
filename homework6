  Based on the Student class written in the previous homework, do the
following:
    1. Write a subclass that inherits from that class.
    2. In this class add the attributes and methods that you desire.
    3. Write a Course class, including its name, semester and any data that
        you’d like to include.
    4. Make the new class able to have many courses as an attribute.
    5. Test the classes creating different objects in different scenarios
